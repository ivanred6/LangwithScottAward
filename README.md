Research within the field of computer vision has recently begun exploring 'Neural Style Transfer', a technique/methodology whereby a neural network is trained to replicate a given artistic style. I've extended this work by asking the question - to what extent can we combine these trained neural networks and, by extension, the artistic style of great works from those such as Van Gogh, Cezanne or Monét? What possibilities exist for 'hybrid' styles? Can AI create new forms of art and, if so, to what extent do people enjoy the perceptual or artistic quality?
